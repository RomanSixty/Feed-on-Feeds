                                     About

   FeedOnFeeds is a lightweight server-based RSS aggregator and reader,
   allowing you to keep up with syndicated content (blogs, comics, and so
   forth) without having to keep track of what you've read. Being
   server-based means all of your feeds and history are kept in one place,
   and being lightweight means you can install it pretty much anywhere
   without needing a fancy dedicated server or the like.

   FeedOnFeeds was originally written by [1]Steve Minutillo; this fork
   strives to stay up-to-date with changes to PHP while improving
   security, multiuser support, and overall design.

                                  Requirements

   FeedOnFeeds requires:
     * A web server running PHP
     * Access to a PDO-capable database (MySQL and SQLite are currently
       supported, and more are easy to add)
     * Specific features may require specific PHP extensions; it is highly
       recommended (but not required) that you have Xlib, cURL, and iconv.

                                  Installation

   To install, simply download a snapshot from [2]the gitweb site, or
   (better yet) clone this git repository to wherever you want it, with:

     git clone http://git.beesbuzz.biz/FeedOnFeeds.git

   Then copy fof-config-sample.php to fof-config.php and edit it as
   appropriate for your setup. If you're on shared hosting, be sure to
   point FOF_DATA_PATH to somewhere in your home directory.

   After that, point a web browser to install.php; For example, if you've
   installed it at http://example.com/fof, go to
   http://example.com/fof/install.php.

                                   Upgrading

   Upgrading to a newer FeedOnFeeds usually just involves downloading a
   new snapshot or issuing a git pull, and then pointing a browser at
   upgrade.php again.

                          Setting up scheduled updates

   FeedOnFeeds works best if you have it set to automatically update your
   feeds on-the-fly. The best way to do this is to set up a cron job like
   so:
   * * * * * curl http://example.com/fof/update-quiet.php

   Don't worry about updates occurring too frequently - FeedOnFeeds will
   only update feeds which are due for an update. By default it will
   update every feed once an hour, but if you enable dynamic update
   intervals in the admin preferences, it will adjust the polling update
   for feeds based on their historical update frequencies.

                                     Legal
